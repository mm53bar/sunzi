# Snipe! #

## Install ##

1. Add the gem:

     gem 'snipe' #, :git => 'git_repo_url'
     bundle install

2. Create a Plowfile:

     ---
     # Remote recipes here will be downloaded to .snipe/recipes.
     production:
       gitrev: https://gist.github.com/mm53bar/5053150/raw/0e870a3a0842f9eb1129f546baf1f63febcac70c/gitrev
       whoami: https://raw.github.com/mm53bar/plow/recipes/bin/whoami
 
     files:
       - ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 
     preferences:
       erase_remote_folder: false
       cache_remote_recipes: false
       erase_local_folder: true
      
3. Make sure you have a .env.production file that has your server connection settings. Something like [.env.sample](https://github.com/mm53bar/plow/blob/master/.env.sample) would work.

4. Run the compile action

     bin/snipe compile production

5. If that works, try to deploy!

     bin/snipe deploy production user@host
